# Introduction
Ovo is a remote-controlled robot equipped with an LCD that displays different faces. Using the control pad, users can move Ovo forward, backward, left, and right, as well as play a short tune. Ovo is controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth through the Bluefruit Connect app. This project was built with the MSP432 Launchpad, TI-RSLK MAX chassis, Bluetooth Low Energy module, a piezo buzzer, and the Nokia 5110 LCD Display.
